#Reviews
- Test the API with 10 games. 
- Revise the 100 most downloaded games from STEAM and edit out any inconsistencies. Keep track of decisions on separate research .MD
- Start compiling the files. 

#NLTK
- Select the key STEM vocabulary to start tracking terms. What should I do if the terms do not show up?
- Find a way to build a list of nodes and edges based on the NLTK output. 

#NetworkX
- Seems straightforward to use. Need to revise the code to make sure it works. Should I conduct a mock of this study using only a few reviews? It seems a problem since the NLTK output will pretty much determine the outcomes of the network. 

#Visualization
Try Pypis. 

#Output
Not sure whether to use Streamlit or Jupyter. Have little experience with both of them. However, Streamlit has some easy to follow tutorials and seems easier to implement than Jupyter.
